# Used to generate a compressed version of the chord table
# (to save MicroPython memory, as it stays fixed)

# A Tetra-Chord has intervals: tone, tone, semitone.
# Concatenate two Tetra-Chords with a bridge tone to get the major scale
# tone, tone, semitone, bridge-tone, tone, tone, semitone
# (additionally, use chromatic names when vocalising,
# so if you have 'D D#' then spell it 'D Eb' so each letter is used once.

# This is a semitone notation ruler, inspired by Candida Tobin's
# work with The Tobin Music Method.
# This notation-ruler has two complete scales concatenated.
# It is used to measure note distances.
# Each tuple index is the position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc)
# Each value is the number of semi-tones away from its root, of that position.

# Notation ruler are note positions, 1-based (1=root)
#    (0)    R 2 3 4 5 6 7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15
NR = (None, 0,2,4,5,7,9,11,12,14,16,17,19,21,23,24)


# Note fingerings are rooted at the lowest touched pad.
# This design is partly inspired by the Guitar Zeros, who used 5 pads
# on a Playstation Guitar Hero controller to finger lots of chords
# using binary patterns on the 5 buttons. However, our approach is moveable
# along the fretboard as we have more touch pads.
#
# The 4 pads to right of root create a pattern that is visually logical
# (for most of the common chords) to aid remembering them.
# If you think of the columns from left to right as 1st 3rd 5th 7th 9th,
# it mostly makes visual sense. There is always a root note fingered,
# as this places the chord position.
#
# The chords chosen for inclusion were selected based on looking at a
# guitar pocket chord book, and also comparing against a number of pop songs
# that we'd like to learn to play. It is not exhaustive.
#
# This design table is ordered in logical order in the hope that it bettr
# conveys the logical design patterns of the fingering. In the actual
# chord table, the fingerings are stored in binary order so that the table
# can use a computed index for a fast lookup.
